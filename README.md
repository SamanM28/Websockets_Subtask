Report - This is the readme file for the Websockets subtask. 


b) Steps taken to finish the task -
1. First I ran all the codes from the shared repository and checked how it functions.

d) Description of the modules - To develop this program, the "websocket" and "asyncio" libraries were used. As the name suggests, the websocket library helped develop the websocket server and client programs, and handle tasks like connecting, sending and receiving data, etc. The asyncio library was used to handle asynchronous tasks.
